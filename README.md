# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply gets the last block number of a blockchain

Try running some of the following commands:

```shell
yarn hardhat accounts
yarn hardhat compile
yarn hardhat clean
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat block-number
```
